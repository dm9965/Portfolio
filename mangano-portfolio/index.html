      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Wearer of many hats, fulfilling the roles of a husband and proud father to three beautiful children,
        while simultaneously pursuing my academic journey as a Software Engineering student at the
        Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY. Ever since my first "Google", I've been
        enamored with computers and how they work, and have now decided to turn my love into a career.
      </p>
      <p>
        By channeling my enthusiasm and determination, I aim to not only excel academically but also seize
        every opportunity that comes my way while broadening my horizons, strengthening my problem-solving
        abilities, and refining my technical skills.
